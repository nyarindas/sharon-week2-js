        <h1> Find your <strong> Akan Name!</strong></h1>
        <p>The Akans have a very unique naming system! It is based on the day a child is born, and on the gender of the child. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture <br> For instance a boy born on a Monday would be named Kwadwo or Koho, and a girl would be called Adwoa. Each day has one or more variants, but there's usually not much to choose from. </p>
            
        <p> The Akans may also have a middle name which is based on a quality, trait, family member or something else. There are some names in this generator which are part of this system, most noticeably the names related to where and/or how the birth took place.
            The Akans also have family names which are often taken from the father's side, but the mother's side may also be taken. This often happens when the mother only has sisters, and the name would thus be lost if nobody takes her name.</p>
